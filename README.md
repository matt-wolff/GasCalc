# GasCalc
This repository is for a simple iOS app I created called GasCalc, which can be used to calculate the price of the gas used in a short car trip within a US state. The motivation behind such an app is that my friend always borrows my car, and I got tired having to calculate how much he owed me using my car's gas mileage, the current price of gas, and the number of miles he traveled. It's much easier to use this app, as it contains the gas mileage (MPG) for all the cars currently listed on www.fueleconomy.gov as of January 3rd 2023, and gets the current gas prices for each state from gasprices.aaa.com.


One issue is that you still have to approximate the number of miles traveled by putting the route into Google Maps. This should be possible to do in-app using the Google Maps API.
